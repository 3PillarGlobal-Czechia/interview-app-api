Setup of a project with propper architecture, guidelines, rules and CI/CD may take a lot of time, days, sometimes even weeks. This repository was created to make that setup easier and faster. 

## Content

* Application layer wihh small number of usecases with example of usage from web api layer
* Infrastructure layer with EF Core, examples of migration and entity class
* Use case controllers on web api layer
* Swagger documentation for versioned api
* Testing, both Unit and Integration, with Xunit and example of test cases
* CI/CD for running test 
* CI/CD for automatic release on tag

## Architecture

* This project contain elements of clean code architecture. 
* We do not follow clean code architecture to the smallest details and some elements werent even used.

General rule is that project is build in way we are viling to reuse it in other projects without difficulty of reimplementation.

We are open to any suggestion how to make architecture better :blush:
